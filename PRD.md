### React Component Architecture (Beginner-Friendly)

#### Component Hierarchy
```jsx
// App.jsx - Main application component
function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <Router>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Landing />} />
          <Route path="/register" element={<Register />} />
          <Route path="/process" element={<ProtectedRoute><Process /></ProtectedRoute>} />
          <Route path="/dashboard" element={<ProtectedRoute><Dashboard /></ProtectedRoute>} />
        </Routes>
        <LoginModal />
        <NotificationSystem />
      </Router>
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Key Components Structure
```jsx
// Landing.jsx - Marketing landing page
function Landing() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      <HeroSection />
      <FeatureSection />
      <SocialProofSection />
      <CTASection />
    </div>
  );
}

// Layout/Navbar.jsx - Authenticated navigation
function Navbar({ user, onLogout }) {
  return (
    <nav className="sticky top-0 bg-white shadow-sm">
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4">
        <div className="flex justify-between items-center h-16">
          <Logo />
          <NavTabs />
          <UserDropdown user={user} onLogout={onLogout} />
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
}

// Process.jsx - Side-by-side processing interface
function Process() {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-8 p-6">
      <UploadPanel />
      <ResultsPanel />
    </div>
  );
}

// Dashboard.jsx - Tabular invoice management
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto p-6">
      <DashboardHeader />
      <StatsCards />
      <InvoiceTable />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Custom Hooks (Educational Patterns)
```jsx
// hooks/useAuth.js - Authentication state management
function useAuth() {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
}

// hooks/useLocalStorage.js - Persistent state management
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = (value) => {
    try {
      setStoredValue(value);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error saving to localStorage:`, error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
}
```

#### Context Providers (State Management)
```jsx
// context/AuthContext.jsx - Global authentication state
const AuthContext = createContext();

export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [token, setToken] = useLocalStorage('authToken', null);

  const login = async (credentials) => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await api.login(credentials);
      setUser(response.user);
      setToken(response.token);
      return { success: true };
    } catch (error) {
      return { success: false, error: error.message };
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  const logout = () => {
    setUser(null);
    setToken(null);
  };

  const value = {
    user,
    loading,
    login,
    logout,
    isAuthenticated: !!user
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

### User Flow
1. **First Visit**: See login/register options in header
2. **Registration**: Click register → modal form → account created → auto-login
3. **Login**: Click login → modal form → authenticated → access main app
4. **Processing**: Upload invoice → process (user-associated) → save to personal history
5. **Dashboard**: View personal invoice history, statistics, manage data

### UI States
- **Unauthenticated**: Login/Register buttons, limited functionality
- **Authenticated**: User menu, full functionality, dashboard access
- **Processing**: Loading states for auth operations
- **Error**: Clear error messages for auth failures

## 🔒 Security Requirements

### Authentication Security
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds (minimum 12)
- **JWT Tokens**: HS256 algorithm, 30-minute expiration
- **Token Storage**: localStorage with automatic cleanup
- **Session Validation**: Server-side token verification on protected routes

### Data Security
- **User Isolation**: Database-level filtering by user_id
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries (already implemented)
- **XSS Protection**: Escape user-generated content

### Privacy Requirements
- **Data Ownership**: Users own their processed invoices
- **Data Deletion**: Users can delete their own invoices
- **No Data Sharing**: Zero cross-user data visibility
- **Audit Trail**: Log authentication events

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(320) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(200),
    hashed_password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add user_id to existing invoices table
ALTER TABLE invoices 
ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL;

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_user ON invoices(user_id);
```

### Data Migration Strategy
- **Existing Data**: Create default admin user, assign existing invoices
- **New Installations**: Start fresh with user registration
- **Rollback Plan**: Remove user_id column, restore original functionality
